	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>We are two movie enthusiasts that have developed this website because we have a passion for films and want to enable people to be able to organise the movies they would like to see, and the movies they enjoy, in a convenient list. We would also like to equip people with the ability to share their movie lists with others. Ever since we were young, we've both shared the dream of being able to create a way for people to share the films they like with each other or simply have access to a list of the movies they've seen, want to see, or even want to avoid in the future. After gaining appropriate knowledge that could enable us to do this, we've worked to make our dream a reality through this website.</p>
