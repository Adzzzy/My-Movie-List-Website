			<h2>Make Your Own List</h2>
			<p>With this website you can make any kind of movie list that you want. You can make a list of the movies that you would like to see in the future or have enjoyed in the past. You can also make a list of the movies you don't want to see or haven't enjoyed in the past. You can make a list of your favourite funny films, your most loved films of the 90's, your top 10 films from a particular director, all the movies you plan to watch over the next month, etc. It's entirely up to <strong>you!</strong></p>

		<div class="firstdes" id="fdes">
			<h2>Unlimited Lists</h2>
			<p>Using this website, you can make as many movie lists that you would like. There is no limit to the amount of lists that you can make so you can go nuts making all kinds of movie lists. Each list is dated so you can also keep track of when you made each of your lists. There is also no limit to the amount of movies that you can add to each list either so you can  make as many lists including as many movies that you want. The only limit is your imagination (and willingness to make each movie list).</p>
			</div>
		<div class="firstdes">
			<h2>Public Lists</h2>
			<p>Each time you make a list it will become available for anyone to see at any time (don't worry if your shy about others seeing your lists, everyone's in the same boat!). Just click on 'BROWSE MOVIE LISTS' at the top of the page to view all the public lists. If you see one you like you can always replicate it and make it your own. Just to warn you in advance, anyone can make an unlimited amount of lists so there may be quite a few to look through if you're looking for something specific!</p>
